/**
 * V6.5 Phase 4: AT Repo Diff Builder
 *
 * Builds a CAR slice from a locally generated AtCommitV1 event for use in
 * the subscribeRepos firehose #commit message.
 *
 * The ATProto sync spec requires that #commit messages include a "blocks"
 * field containing a CAR slice with the commit block and all changed data
 * blocks, with the commit CID as the first root.
 *
 * Phase 4 scope:
 *   - Supports only diffs generated from locally created commits.
 *   - Does not reconstruct arbitrary historical diffs.
 *   - CAR slice is a mock Uint8Array pending real IPLD/CAR library integration.
 *
 * Ref: https://atproto.com/specs/event-stream#commit
